    <h1>Early Years</h1>

<p> Frida Kahlo, in full Frida Kahlo de Rivera,original name Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón,
    <br>
    born July 6, 1907, Coyoacán, Mexico. The Mexican painter best known for her uncompromising and
    <br>
    brilliantly coloured self-portraits that deal with such themes as identity,the human body, and death.
    <br>
    Although she denied the connection, she is often identified as a Surrealist. In addition to her work,
    <br>
    Kahlo was known for her tumultuous relationship with muralist Diego Rivera 
    <br>
    (married 1929, divorced 1939, remarried 1940).
<br>
<br>
Kahlo was born to a German father of Hungarian descent and a Mexican mother
<br>
of Spanish and Native American descent. Later, during her artistic career,
<br>
Kahlo explored her identity by frequently depicting her ancestry as binary
<br>
opposites: the colonial European side and the indigenous Mexican side. As a
<br>
child, she suffered a bout of polio that left her with a slight limp, a chronic
<br>
ailment she would endure throughout her life. Kahlo was especially close to her
<br>
father, who was a professional photographer, and she frequently assisted him in
<br>
his studio, where she acquired a sharp eye for detail. Although Kahlo took some
<br>
drawing classes, she was more interested in science, and in 1922 she entered the
<br>
National Preparatory School in Mexico City with an interest in eventually studying
<br>
medicine. While there she met Rivera, who was working on a mural for the school’s
<br>
auditorium.
<br>
<br>
In 1925 Kahlo was involved in a bus accident, which so seriously injured her that she
<br>
had to undergo more than 30 medical operations in her lifetime. During her slow recovery,
<br>
Kahlo taught herself to paint, and she read frequently, studying the art of the Old Masters.
<br>
In one of her early paintings, Self-Portrait Wearing a Velvet Dress (1926), Kahlo painted a
<br>
regal waist-length portrait of herself against a dark background with roiling stylized waves.
<br>
Although the painting is fairly abstract, Kahlo’s soft modeling of her face shows her interest
<br>
in realism. The stoic gaze so prevalent in her later art is already evident, and the exaggeratedly
<br>
long neck and fingers reveal her interest in the Mannerist painter Il Bronzino. After her convalescence,
<br>
Kahlo joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM), where she met Rivera once again. She showed him
<br>
some of her work, and he encouraged her to continue to paint.
</p>

<h1> Marriage to Diego Rivera and the USA</h1>

<p>Soon after marrying Rivera in 1929, Kahlo changed her personal and painting style. She began to wear the
    <br>
    traditional Tehuana dress that became her trademark. It consisted of a flowered headdress, a loose blouse,
    <br>
    gold jewelry, and a long ruffled skirt. Her painting Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931) shows not only her new
    <br>
    attire but also her new interest in Mexican folk art. The subjects are flatter and more abstract than those
    <br>
    in her previous work. The towering Rivera stands to the left, holding a palette and brushes, the objects of
    <br>
    his profession. He appears as an important artist, while Kahlo, who is petite and demure beside him, with her
    <br>
    hand in his and with darker skin than in her earlier work, conveys the role she presumed he wanted: a traditional
    <br>
    Mexican wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kahlo painted that work while traveling in the United States (1930–33) with Rivera, who had received commissions for
    <br>
    murals from several cities. During this time, she endured a couple of difficult pregnancies that ended prematurely.
    <br>
    After suffering a miscarriage in Detroit and later the death of her mother, Kahlo painted some of her most-harrowing
    <br>
    works. In Henry Ford Hospital (1932) Kahlo depicted herself hemorrhaging on a hospital bed amid a barren landscape,
    <br>
    and in My Birth (1932) she painted a rather taboo scene of a shrouded woman giving birth.
</p>

<h1>First solo exhibitions</h1>

<p>
    In 1933 Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico, where they lived in a newly constructed house comprising separate individual
    <br>
    spaces joined by a bridge. The residence became a gathering spot for artists and political activists, and the couple hosted
    <br>
    he likes of Leon Trotsky and André Breton, a leading Surrealist who championed Kahlo’s work. Breton wrote the introduction
    <br>
    to the brochure for her first solo exhibition, describing her as a self-taught Surrealist. The exhibition was held at the
    <br>
    Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938, and it was a great success. The following year Kahlo traveled to Paris to show her
    <br>
    work. There she met more Surrealists, including Marcel Duchamp, the only member she reportedly respected. The Louvre also
    <br>
    acquired one of her works, The Frame (c. 1938), making Kahlo the first 20th-century Mexican artist to be included in the 
    <br>
    museum’s collection.
</p>

<h1>The Two Fridas and later works</h1>

<p>
    By the mid-1930s numerous extramarital affairs—notably that of Rivera with Kahlo’s younger sister and those of
    <br>
    Kahlo with several men and women—had undermined their marriage, and the two divorced in 1939. That same year Kahlo painted
    <br>
    some of her most famous works, including The Two Fridas. The unusually large canvas (5.69 × 5.68 feet [1.74 × 1.73 metres])
    <br>
    shows twin figures holding hands, each figure representing an opposing side of Kahlo. The figure to the left, dressed in a
    <br>
    European-style wedding dress, is the side that Rivera purportedly rejected, and the figure to the right, dressed in Tehuana
    <br>
    attire, is the side Rivera loved best. The full heart of the indigenous Kahlo is on display, and from it an artery leads to
    <br>
    a miniature portrait of Rivera that she holds in her left hand. Another artery connects to the heart of the other Kahlo, which
    <br>
    is fully exposed and reveals the anatomy within. The end of the artery is cut, and the European Kahlo holds a surgical instrument
    <br>
    seemingly to stem the flow of blood that drips onto her white dress.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kahlo reconciled with Rivera in 1940, and the couple moved into her childhood home, La Casa Azul (“the Blue House”), in Coyoacán.
    <br>
    In 1943 she was appointed a professor of painting at La Esmeralda, the Education Ministry’s School of Fine Arts. Never fully well,
    <br>
    Kahlo began to further decline in health, and she frequently turned to alcohol and drugs for relief. Nonetheless, she continued to be
    <br>
    productive during the 1940s. She painted numerous self-portraits with varying hairstyles, clothing, and iconography, always showing herself
    <br>
    with an impassive, steadfast gaze, for which she became famous. Kahlo underwent several surgeries in the late 1940s and early ’50s, often with
    <br>
    prolonged hospital stays. Toward the end of her life, she required assistance with walking. She appears in Self-Portrait with Portrait of Dr.
    <br>
    Farill (1951) seated in a wheelchair. Her ill health caused her to attend her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953 lying on a bed. She died
    <br>
    in La Casa Azul a year later, the official cause documented as a pulmonary embolism.

<h1>The Frida Kahlo Museum and posthumous reputation</h1>

<p>

After Kahlo’s death, Rivera had La Casa Azul redesigned as a museum dedicated to her life. The Frida Kahlo Museum opened
<br>
to the public in 1958, a year after Rivera’s death. The Diary of Frida Kahlo, covering the years 1944–54, and The Letters
<br>
of Frida Kahlo were both published in 1995. Although Kahlo had achieved success as an artist in her lifetime, her posthumous
<br>
reputation steadily grew from the 1970s and reached what some critics called “Fridamania” by the 21st century. She is perhaps
<br>
one of the best-known artists of the 20th century. The dramatic parts of her life—the debilitating injury from the bus accident,
<br>
the turbulent marriage, the sensational love affairs, and the heavy drinking and drug use—inspired many books and movies in the 
<br>
decades following her death.
